**Using measurement overlap to find significant results**  

_Definition_    

Overestimating the magnitude of an effect that is largely due to measurement overlap of two seemingly distinct constructs.  

_Alias(es) and related concepts_

Leveraging the jangle fallacy

None  
  

_Examples_  

(1) Researcher is using similar items in two seemingly different constructs and concludes that the constructs have a high correlation.
(2) Researcher finds a positive relationship between depression and suicidality, but the positive relation is in part due to the depression scale already containing items about suicide.

(2)     Researcher reports p-values only and conceals test statistics.
(3)     Researcher reports a correlation without disclosing the degrees of freedom, number of observations, or confidence interval, so it seems like the effect is large (for example r=.70, n=15, CI=[.01; .90]).

**Selective reporting of hypotheses**  

_Definition_    

Reporting hypothesis test only if it fits the researcher's expectation.  

_Alias(es) and related concepts_

Cherry-picking hypotheses, 
Chrysalis effect, 
Fishing expedition  

_Umbrella term(s)_

Cherry-picking  

_Examples_  

(1) Researcher formulates five hypotheses of which only three are supported by the data - only these 3 get reported in the final research report (Chrysalis effect).
(2) Fishing expedition - The researcher surveys college students about the outfit they are wearing and their scores on several tests which allows for many possible analyses (examining different colors, types of clothing, tests, score cutoffs, etc.). They end up reporting only a subset of findings to claim college students perform significantly better on tests when they are wearing green. See also Modifying measurement, Selective reporting of indicator variables, and Selective reporting of outcomes.  

_Potential damages_  

- Inflated confidence in the research
